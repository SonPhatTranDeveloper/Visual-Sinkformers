# Meeting 0: Kick-start the project

The points discussed in this meeting ares:
- **Feasibility of the pre-training of the project**: Pre-training a model like DINOv2 will be very expensive and finicky,
so we should stick to fine-tuning a pre-trained model instead.
- **Existing codebase**: There is an existing codebase for Sinkformers and DINOv2, so build up the project from this.
- **Preliminary report**: At the end of the first semester, produce an internal report (can be short).
- **Marking scheme**: The marking of the project can be like: 
  - 10% for the final presentation (external grader).
  - 30% for the code (supervisor).
  - 60% for the thesis (external grader).
- **Novel contribution**: The novel contribution of the project can be something like:
  - Fine-tuning using a convex combination  of the sink-horn and softmax.
  - Fine-tuning using few iterations of the sink-horn algorithm always ending with row normalisation.

The next meeting is on the **4th of March 2024**.
